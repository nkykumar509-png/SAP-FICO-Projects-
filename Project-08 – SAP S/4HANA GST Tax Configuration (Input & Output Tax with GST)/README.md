Project-08 – SAP S/4HANA GST (Goods & Services Tax) Configuration

Objective: Configure GST taxation structure in SAP S/4HANA for India including creation of tax procedure, tax codes (I1/O1), access sequence, condition types, assignment of GL accounts, vendor tax master data update and invoice posting validation via FB60/MIRO and FB70.

GST must be automatically calculated during AR invoice posting in FB70

Separate GL accounts should be hit for Input GST (CGST/SGST/IGST) and Output GST

GST posting must appear in Vendor line item display (FBL1N) and GST GL reporting (FAGLL03)

GST tax codes must be configured for different tax rates such as I1 / O1 (18% GST)

Scope of Work:

SPRO configuration of GST Tax Procedure (ZGST)

Define and assign condition types for CGST, SGST, IGST

Maintain access sequences and calculation rules
